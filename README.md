## Introduce
Now I have successfully completed my graduate studies at the CZU in Prague, where I defended my master thesis on Modern JavaScript frameworks.
I am now looking forward to the opportunity to learn new things and join a work team where I can bring my energy and passion for technological innovation. I approach challenges with enthusiasm and am motivated by the continuous development in the field.

I like programming, I deal mainly with ***front-end*** (Vue, React, TypeScipt, ...). **I'll just learn it if I don't know it.**
